Scenario 1:

There is only one mqttConnect for both connect and Reconnect.
There is only one Disconnect.
There will be only one connection instance active per one server and APN(ipAddress).

BootUp/Reboot:
1.)All Applications will try to invoke CCMCONNECT API with relevant Server and its details 
read from CustomerProperties file in device(app/conf/)
2.)In CcmConnect implementation, Set datastructure has been used to store the details by having unique server and APN(ipAddress).

Positive
Connect Flow on powerBootUp Limited Mode,
1.)ConnectToServer will be invoked only after got the event from Telephony[DefaultGateWay].
    it make sure  that ipAddress,dataConnection Available so the Mqtt connect happend succesfully.
2.)In Telephony Defaultgateway Event, the InternetAvailable flag will be set to TRUE.

During Connect,If the DataConnection Lost Abruptly during Connection:
1.)In Telephony DataDisconnect Event, the InternetAvailable flag will be set to False.

During connect, if the Queue got deleted from Server,
1)the ConnectLost method from CallBack API, 
will check for if internet status available and will  will retry to connect by calling connectToServer method().


During SleepMode:
1.Ccm will check any data available in database or not.if data exists it will send to web.
2.Then Disconnect () method will be invoked.
3. In Disconnect
    * First it will check for InternetAvailable,using InternetAvailable flag from TelephonyEvent
      if available, then it will do null check for mqttclient obj and mqttclient connected.
      it will do Disconnect
      it will make the mqttClient instance to null.
      (These checks are needed because the thread has been in hangstate without these checks)
    * if the Internet is not available,then it will skip the whole process and mqtt obj reference still be there.
    
During Limited(after SleepMode)
1.)TelephonyEvent will trigger the ConnectToServer() and internally check for MqttConnect available or not.
2.)if during MqttDisconnect didnt clear the instance, then same instance will be connected again.
3.)if during MqttDisconnect cleared the instance, then new instance and new connection will be created.
